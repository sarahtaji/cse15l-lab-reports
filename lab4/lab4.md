*Keys pressed:* `Ctrl-C`, `Ctrl-V` and `<enter>`

> To securely connect to my remote server, I first located the SSH command ```ssh cs15lfa23hj@ieng6.ucsd.edu```. I highlighted this phrase and copied it using ```Ctrl-C```. I then pasted the command using Ctrl-V into my terminal. To initiate the connection, I pressed ```<enter>```. This action executed the ```SSH``` command, establishing a secure link with my remote server and enabling me to log in.

## 5. Clone your fork of the repository from your GitHub account (using the SSH URL)

*Keys pressed:* `Clear`, `Ctrl-C`, type `git clone`, `Ctrl-V`, and `<enter>`.

> `Clear` command to empty my terminal then Copy the SSH URL `git@github.com:sarahtaji/lab7.git` of the *lab7* repository from my GitHub account by pressing `Ctrl-C` after highlighting the URL. Then, clone the repository into ieng6 by using the command `git clone`. Press `Ctrl-V` to paste the SSH URL just copied, and press `<Enter>` to execute the command. The `git clone` command is used to create a copy of an existing repository into a new directory on your local machine.

## 6. Run the tests, demonstrating that they fail

*Keys pressed:* Type `cd lab7` and press `<enter>` Then type `"bash test"`, press `<tab>` and `<enter>`.

> Changed the working directory to the `/lab7` directory. Then, execute the bash scripts in `test.sh` by using the `bash` command. To speed up the process, press `<tab>` after typing `"bash te"` in the terminal. This will autocomplete the command with the existing filename inside the `/lab7` directory.

## 7. Edit the code file to fix the failing test

## 9. Commit and push the resulting change to your Github account
